  Litle bit of this and that.. I have bachelors degree in Informatics, I am tech savvy and in general I am a bit of a geek :)
1.4) Do you have a dream project which this training would allow you to complete?
  I want to have a diy smart house solution for multiple rooms:
    has to be scaleable
    I am thinking about remote wireless nodes in each room
    one node per room - they should be able to work seperatly, but also exchange information
    every node has to be able to control of lights, blinds, music and tv, sensors
    would love to include google home as UI
    if this beast would not burn my home - that would be an advantage
